This is Simple CRUD Play Application (Student CRUD)
Steps to run this application on your system:
Clone repository to your system using git clone https://mahendrabagul@bitbucket.org/mahendrabagul/final-demo.git
I assume, you have play 2.3.x version installed on your system.
Now, create a database in MySQL on your system. Name it as you want.
Configure application.conf file in project's conf directory.
Specify your database name, username and password.
Now, run activator run from your terminal window(you should be in root directory of project).
And, goto http://localhost:9000 to view the output.
Thanks, Mahendra Bagul
