This is Simple CRUD Play Application (Student CRUD)
===========================================

Steps to run this application on your system:

1. Clone repository to your system using 
          git clone https://mahendrabagul@bitbucket.org/mahendrabagul/final-demo.git
2. I assume, you have play 2.3.x version installed on your system.

3. Now, create a database in MySQL on your system. Name it as you want.

4. Configure **application.conf** file in project's **conf** directory.

5. Specify your database name, username and password.

6. Now, run **activator run** from your terminal window(you should be in root directory of project).

And, goto **http://localhost:9000** to view the output.
